Claudia JS Example projects. To get started, make sure your credentials are configured. See the [ClaudiaJS Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia/blob/master/getting_started.md) for more information.

Note that AWS Lambda currently runs Node.js version 0.10.36, so it's best to use that version for testing.
